## Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of auto sales data. The analysis details information on 18,619 auto sales orders over a three-year period (January 2018 to May 2020). The EDA aims to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships among sales, customer behavior, and product characteristics, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of auto sales. These insights can aid in informed decision-making and strategic planning for the automotive industry.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this EDA are to:
1. Uncover the distribution of sales across different product lines, countries, deal sizes, and time periods.
2. Identify the product lines with the highest average sales and the most volatile sales trends.
3. Assess how sales vary by country and the proportion of different deal sizes.
4. Analyze the evolution of sales over the three-year period and identify any significant trends or patterns.
5. Evaluate the correlation between sales and order date, customer country, deal size, and month.
6. Gain insights into customer behavior and preferences based on sales data.
7. Identify potential areas for optimization and improvement in sales performance.

## Data Description
The dataset for this EDA consists of the following variables:
- **SALES**: The total sales value of an order (numerical).
- **ORDERDATE**: The date the order was placed (date).
- **STATUS**: The status of the order (shipped, cancelled, disputed, on hold) (categorical).
- **PRODUCTLINE**: The type of product sold (classic cars, vintage cars, trucks-n-buses, motorcycles, trains, aircraft, ships) (categorical).
- **COUNTRY**: The country of the customer (USA, Spain, France, Australia, UK, Germany, Canada, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Portugal, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Russia, China) (categorical).
- **DEALSIZE**: The size of the order (small, medium, large) (categorical).
